puppet-git-hooks
================

Project moved to https://github.com/gini/puppet-git-hooks


githooks(5) scripts to work with repositories of Puppet code.


Installation
------------

Just copy the scripts to your repository into the `.git/hooks/` directory.
Make sure that the filename conforms to one of the hooks listed in
[githooks(5)](http://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) and that the executable bit
has been set.


Hooks
-----
**pre-commit:**

This pre-commit hook verifies that Puppet can parse \*.pp files (using `puppet parser validate`),
that the manifests conform to the [Puppet Labs style guide](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/style_guide.html),
that YAML files are parseable, and that templates (\*.erb) have valid syntax.

The commit hook can be configured with the following environment variables:

* `PUPPETLINT_FLAGS`: Command line parameters for [puppet-lint](http://puppet-lint.com/), 
  default: `--no-autoloader_layout-check --no-80chars-check`
* `TMPDIR`: The directory in which temporary files should be written, default: `/tmp`
